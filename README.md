This repository provides Color Space Conversion Transforms for use with ACES.
Some transforms may require code from the
[`aces-core`](https://github.com/aces-aswf/aces-core) repository. 

In earlier versions of ACES, Input Transforms used the `IDT` token in filenames
and TransformIDs. In ACES 2, the `CSC` token is used, indicating that a
transform may function either as an Input Transforms or as a general CSC.

## Input Transforms
Input Transforms, i.e. CSCs converting _to_ ACES2065-1, included here are
supplied manufacturers or derived from manufacturer-published documentation.
They are provided for convenience only and may not represent the latest
recommendations from the manufacturer. While efforts are made to maintain
accuracy, users should confirm with the manufacturer that they are using the
most current IDTs for their camera.

## Contributing

ACES depends on community participation. Developers, manufacturers, and end
users are encouraged to contribute code, bug fixes, documentation, and other
technical artifacts.

All contributors must have a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file
